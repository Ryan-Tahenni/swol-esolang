# swol-esolang

------------------
S.W.O.L. is a very buggy esolang built on top of python. S.W.O.L. stand for: Slow Weird One Line (for the language) or Script With One Line (for the file format (.swol)). One perk is that you have to seperate everything (functions, strings etc...) with underscores (see example.swol).

-----------------
To use this language:
  1. Download python ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
  2. Download the repo
  3. Create a file that ends in .swol with any editor (eg. Notepad)
  4. Try a script like this: `a_=_I_(_"What's your name? "_)_;_P_(_"Hello, "_+_a_)`
  5. Run the swol.py file, set the mode to run, type the path to the file
  6. If everything worked, it sould print the python version and run the script
